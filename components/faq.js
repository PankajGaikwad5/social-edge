    ques: `Are there any additional requirements for my current username?`,
    ans: `Your existing account that we'll be swapping the username to should be representative of the name/entity we are claiming the username for. It should have atleast 20 posts, been active within the last 60 days and have atleast a thousand or so followers. These are not absolute necessities but will drastically improve our ability to argue for the claim. If you are a corporate entity claiming your business username, documents of a trademark agreement woule be of immense help.`,

    ques: `Are there any additional requirements for artist verification?`,
    ans: `Yes we require that your discography dates back at least a year or more or more, you have at least a year or more, you have at least 5 published projects within said discography, you have a verified spotify profile and lastly, a Google Knowledge Panel. If all of those requirements are met, we are able to offer a full PR + Instagram verification service package for $7000 only for this particular category. We will publish all of your needed PR and subsequently verify your profile within just a single transaction.`,

    ques: `What if I don't meet the PR requirements?`,
    ans: `Not to worry. As a PR agency, we specialize in obtaining a wide variety of PR placements in the PR section of our site which you can purchase seperately. Alternatively, you can also hire us in full capacity as your publicist to build up your media presence directly as we see fit. This service includes the creation of wiki pages, Google Knowledge Panels, and various author and contibutor profiles to ensure you are dominating the search engine results for your name or brand.`,

    ques: `Why can't I just apply through the App?`,
    ans: `We encourage everyone to try their luck but as you'll likely come to find out, the odds are stacked against you, Less than 1% of cases made via the in-app verification form ever get approved. Believe it or not, even your favourite celebrities have to go through the exact same process (albeit their publicist handles everything on their behalf). Keep in mind that only just three years ago, there was no in-app submission form. All verification requests were processed in the exact same manner that we process them now - through an official Media Partner.`,

    ques: `How do i know if my articles meet the notability standards?`,
    ans: `A metric commonly used to determine whether your existing media coverage is of any use towards your verification goals is to analyze each publication's domain authority. Cheaper categories such as artists can get away with having 7 - 12 full feature articles on publications with a DA of 60 and above whereas pricier and more difficult categories such as Entrepreneurs and Brands will require articles on publications with a DA in the 80s-90s range. In any event, we conduct analyses of all our submitted cases and will let you know as soon as possible if your pre-existing press meets Meta's criteria.`,
